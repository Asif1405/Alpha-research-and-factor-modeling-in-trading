# Alpha-research-and-factor-modeling-in-trading

### Overview:
In this project, we built a statistical risk model using PCA. We used this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. We created these factors, then evaluated them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, we optimized the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset, we used the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
